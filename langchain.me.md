Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

- **`langchain-core`**: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.
- Integration packages (e.g. **`langchain-openai`**, **`langchain-anthropic`**, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
- **`langchain`**: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
- **`langchain-community`**: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
- **[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph)**: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph. Integrates smoothly with LangChain, but can be used without it.
- **[LangGraphPlatform](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/#langgraph-platform)**: Deploy LLM applications built with LangGraph to production.
- **[LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)**: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
